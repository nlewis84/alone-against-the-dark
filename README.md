## Alone Against the Dark

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/nlewis84?style=social)

This is a JavaScript game that implements the story Alone Against the Dark by Matthew J. Costello.

This is a basic implementation of Call of Cthulhu 2nd Edition rules. I do not take credit for the substance of this story.
