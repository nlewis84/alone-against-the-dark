text-adventure is an JavaScript game that implements the story Alone Against the Dark by Matthew J. Costello.

This is a basic implementation of Call of Cthulhu 2nd Edition rules. I do not take credit for the substance of this story. At this point, I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am starting to feel comfortable with basics of JavaScript and wanted to try my hand at making something on my own.

## Running text-adventure
Download this project, run `yarn start` in the root directory, and open up your browser to `http://localhost:3000/` to see it in action (the browser should open automatically for you!)
